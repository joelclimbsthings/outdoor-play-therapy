# Update Site

Deploy all current changes to the live site.

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` to check for changes
2. If there are changes:
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message summarizing what changed
   - Push to origin/main with `git push origin main`
3. If there are no changes, let the user know the site is already up to date
