      <h2>Do you ever worry if your child has the tools they need to reach their goals?</h2>
      <p>Our world is often designed for neurotypical minds and people with diverse ways of thinking and processing can face unnecessary barriers. I believe in teaching how to adapt environments to embrace neurodiversity while equipping our children/teens with practical skills to navigate their daily lives. Unlike traditional clinic settings, I bring occupational therapy into the community. Why? Because this is our natural environment; this is where we live day to day. This is where the unpredictable happens: where we learn to navigate social situations, unexpected sensory experiences, and changes in plans. This is where we put our coping tools to use and learn to self-advocate for our needs.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I believe in the transformative power of play and meaningful connection. My approach is rooted in the understanding that we all learn and grow through play, whether we're 5 or 18 or 45. Play can be so many things: a game of hide and seek, making a craft from materials you find outside, or adventure sports such as stand up paddle boarding or rock climbing. I partner closely with families, recognizing them as essential members of each child or teen's therapeutic journey and empowering them with tools to support their child or teen's development.</p>
      <p>I believe in honoring each person's voice and autonomy, celebrating their unique strengths while nurturing areas for growth. This therapeutic environment fosters vital social-emotional skills, teaching children and teens how to understand their bodies and feelings, regulate their responses, and build meaningful connections within their community. Through respectful, collaborative relationships with both children/teens and their families, the goal is to create a supportive space where every child or teen can thrive in their own special way.</p>

      <h2>About Michelle Thiessen OTR/L</h2>
      <p>I'm a licensed occupational therapist and mom to two beautiful kids. My love of the outdoors has been my peaceful sanctuary through some of the hardest moments in life. I'm thrilled to bring together two of my biggest loves: kids and the outdoors to hopefully share the power this connection can bring.</p>
      <p>In my early years, I ran a community supported agriculture (CSA) small scale farm and worked with classrooms of kids to explore the wonders of farming. After graduating in 2018 from Colorado State University, I trained at STAR (Sensory Therapy and Research) institute in Denver, CO and gained a deeper understanding of treating kids with sensory processing differences. Afterwards, I moved back to Oregon and began my work as an occupational therapist in an outpatient clinic. There I began embracing the outdoor spaces at the clinic including the playground, gardening, barn activities, and hippotherapy as tools for therapy. I have also worked in early intervention, early childhood special education, and home pediatric care.</p>
      <p>In my leisure time I enjoy hanging out with my husband and kids, rock climbing, backpacking, snowshoeing, mountain biking, gardening, making crafts, dancing, and cooking. Bend is a beautiful place to call home and I feel fortunate to be part of this community.</p>

      <h2>Research Supporting Therapeutic Benefit of Thoughtful Movement for Adolescents and Kids with ADHD</h2>
      <p>Climbing and adventure sports act as powerful brain-body workouts requiring mind and body synchronization. Unlike repetitive exercise, climbing presents complex puzzles demanding sustained attention and impulse control; losing focus results in slipping. This real-time feedback trains brains to employ "Stop-Plan-Do-Check" strategies before each movement.</p>
      <p>As teens master difficult motor skills, they upgrade their brain's operating system. Research demonstrates coordinative movement primes the prefrontal cortex, improving focus, memory, and challenge adaptation. Problem-solving skills learned during climbing translate into superior self-regulation and classroom focus.</p>
